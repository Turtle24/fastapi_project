# fastapi_project

A FastAPI project built using a weather api and a local instance of a MySQL database in order to explore the framework. I created a database connection, created post, get, put and delete endpoints. JWT, hashing and tokens were implemented for authentication to access the weather endpoints. The project was an exploration project as I wanted to learn more about FastAPI and implement aysncio. I implemented environment variables, requirements.txt and .gitignore in order to apply good practices.
